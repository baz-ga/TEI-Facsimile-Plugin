TEI-Facsimile-Plugin
====================

A plugin that provides support for working with  Digital Facsimiles in Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) vocabulary.   The plugin contributes a new View in which the user can load an image and draw shapes. These shapes are then  converted into TEI "zone" elements. All the existing "zone" elements from the document are also rendered over the image.
