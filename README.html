    <h1>Samples for the oXygen SDK</h1>
    <p>The oXygen SDK allows you to extend or create new applications based on the oXygen XML
      editing technology. </p>

      <h2>Keep what you need</h2>
      <p>This sample project is modular. You can keep any of the main sample sub-projects and its
        dependencies and delete the rest. Make sure you update also the pom.xml file.</p>
      <p>For instance if you want to develop a web application you could keep the
          <code>oxygen-sample-webapp</code> and delete from the filesystem the other
          <code>oxygen-sample-*</code> projects. Since this project depends on the other
          <code>bundle-*</code> projects make sure you keep them.</p>
    </section>
    <section><h2>How to build the project</h2><p>All the subprojects, except for the <code><a
            href="oxygen-sample-applet/README.html">oxygen-sample-applet</a></code> can be built
        directly. The applet project needs extra configuration, in order to be able to sign and
        deploy the applet to a web server.</p>So, running the
      command<pre>mvn install</pre></section>
    <p>will build all artifacts, but will fail building the applet. </p>
